# lua-shooter-game
I created a full game in Lua for my A levels in computer science. This OOP game features multiple moving elements, where players shoot enemies, use items, gain powerups, and progress through waves. The game includes items scattered through a map, enemies drop powerups, an increasing enemy difficulty, music, menus, and pause functionality.
